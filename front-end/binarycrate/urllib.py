    Each part of a URL, e.g. the path info, the query, etc., has a
    different set of reserved characters that must be quoted.
    RFC 2396 Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax lists
    the following reserved characters.
    reserved    = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                  "$" | ","
    Each of these characters is reserved in some component of a URL,
    but not necessarily in all of them.
    By default, the quote function is intended for quoting the path
    section of a URL.  Thus, it will not encode '/'.  This character
    is reserved, but in typical usage the quote function is being
    called on a path where the existing slash characters are used as
    reserved characters.
